## How to add in Consent-O-Matic
Go to the configuration menu for Consent-O-Matic, then head to `Rules list`.\
You should now find the URL of the default Consent-O-Matic rules.

Add `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/azalty/Consent-O-Matic-List/main/rules-list.json`

## Additional infos
Some rules here are incomplete: they will only work if you have no cookie preferences enabled (reject all), or all enabled (accept all).\
If you have enabled some cookie preferences, some rules will just not do anything, or try to hide the popup.\
The most commonly supported mode is reject all.

If you want more in-depth support for a particular website, feel free to ask by creating an issue.
